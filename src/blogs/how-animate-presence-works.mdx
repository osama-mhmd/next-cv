If you are a frontend developer, you probably know that `motion` is a library that helps you to 
animate your components. It is a great library, but it has a problem. When you use it, the DOM is not 
updated until the animation is done. This means that if you have a lot of animations, the DOM will 
be updated many times. This is not a good thing, because it will make your website slower.
