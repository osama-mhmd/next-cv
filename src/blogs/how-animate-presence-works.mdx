If you are a frontend developer, you probably know that `motion` is a library that helps you to 
animate your components. But the most interesting thing in this library is that your animations are
not removed from the DOM until the animation is done. Take an example:

```jsx
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "motion/react";
import { useState } from "react";

const Box = motion.custom(function Box({ show }) {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(true);

  return (
    <AnimatePresence>
      {visible && (
        <motion.div
          initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -30 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
          exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 30 }}
        >âš¾</motion.div>
      )}
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
});
```

You will notice that the `button` is not shifted up until the animation is finished
